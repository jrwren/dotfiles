## Notes

Notes to myself.

## Jay R. Wren dotfiles

These are my dot files, mostly .bashrc and .vimrc are what I care about, but I
may dump other things here too.

If you opt to use the .vimrc you'll need to get fugitive
https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive, and clone whatever fugitive plugins I
use. (no one will use my setup anyway.)
